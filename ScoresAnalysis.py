This function iterates over the indexes of the stream of notes and looks for augumented seconds between consecutive notes. Each time an augumented second is found, the aug_second counter is updated.

If the parameter flag is 1, it prints the results as indicated ("instrument_name" is used to adjust the name of the analysed part). If the flag is 0, as predifined, it returns the number of augmented seconds found in a given part.
